Great effort giving it a try!  Let's fine-tune your push-ups.  

Focus on keeping your body in a straight line from head to heels â€“ avoid sagging in the middle.  Imagine a straight plank.  Also, keep your elbows closer to your body as you lower down, not flared out to the sides.  You'll get those reps easily with these small adjustments.  Keep up the great work!
