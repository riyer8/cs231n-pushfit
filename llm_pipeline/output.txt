Great effort!  Let's fine-tune your push-ups.  Focus on keeping your body in a straight line from head to heels â€“ avoid sagging in the hips.  Imagine a straight plank.  Also, try to keep your elbows closer to your body; they look a little flared out.  With those small adjustments, you'll feel a much better workout!  Keep up the amazing work!
